Many of my professors said I was the best student they had seen in their entire careers. Over time, I grew to specialize in abstract and linear algebra, but representation theory and algebraic topology also hold a special place in my heart. As I have moved more into the world of programming and web design, my linear algebra skills have come in handy, as has my training in combinatorial and discrete mathematics! The mathematical prowess has given me a boost on diving into machine learning, data analytics, and algorithms."
